                                Over the decades, and often imperceptibly, every home, street and workplace was shaped 
                                by the work of Medical Officers of Health (MOHs). In their reports we find unexpected 
                                angles on histories as diverse as work and empire.

                                their cargoes across the globe, and in doing so they vividly convey London's position 
                                at the centre of a world trading system.

                                It is in discussions of bylaws on the disposal of dead horse carcasses or on the 
                                creation of manure and refuse sites that we can track the gradual cleaning of the 
                                streets; and it is in the testing and removal of contaminated milk by sanitary 
                                inspectors as much as in the growth of sanatoria and vaccination that we can understand 
                                the decline of tuberculosis.

                                In the 1860s around a third of all deaths were from infectious disease; this had 
                                declined to a quarter by 1911, and to under 4% by 1951.

                                While the Corporation of the City of London remained largely independent in its working, 
                                the rest of the metropolis was organised by parishes run by their vestries. In 1855 
                                these were brought under the overview of the

                                scabies and impetigo, and suffering from uncorrected squints or physical disabilities 
                                reveal how poverty was inscribed on the bodies of London's poorest. Over time, open 
                                sewers, contaminated water, damp bedrooms infested with bugs, tuberculosis-infected 
                                milk and high infant mortality rates became less common, largely disappearing by the 
                                1970s.

                                If the reports chart the decline of some issues, they also track the rise of others â€“ 
                                heart diseases and cancer gained relentless prominence from the interwar period. After 
                                1945, the expanded place of social services in the lives of Londoners is reflected in 
                                the number of committees and services dealing with "juvenile delinquents", "maladjusted 
                                children", "problem families" and indeed "potential problem families".

                                Often the lives of London's women are revealed in the MOH reports in the starkest terms: 
                                maternal mortality rates, which remained stubbornly high into the 1930s, were perhaps 
                                the most visible indicator. But, by looking for example at numbers of people per room, 
                                infant mortality rates, deaths from infectious disease, and the percentage of women with 
                                profound dental decay or children with rickets, it is not hard to gain an insight into 
                                how poor nutrition, scarce resources and slum housing shaped millions of women's 
                                everyday existence.
                            </p>

                                We also see the changing lives of women in the different ways in which they appear as 
                                medical professionals in MOH reports. At first completely absent, they have their 
                                <a title="1855-6 MOH Report City of London" href="/report/b18197292/22">first mention 
                                    as nurses in 1856</a> - though not yet as part of the public health profession, but 
                                rather lumped in with domestic servants in a consideration of different occupational 
                                death rates. Gradually, however, they slip into the pages, as nurses, handywomen and 
                                midwives, then medical assistants, and finally Assistant MOHs and even full MOHs. We 
                                also see the creation of the roles of health visitor, school nurse and social worker - 
                                professions dominated by women.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If MOH reports are able to give unique insights into the changes and developments in 
                                London life and that of the nation, they are no less equipped to reveal the continuities. 
                                Infant and maternal mortality rates may have decreased, yet the depressing fact revealed 
                                in MOH reports is that poor Londoners continued to be far unhealthier, live in 
                                unsatisfactory or overcrowded housing and be more vulnerable to occupational illnesses 
                                than the rich. Slum housing and health inequalities across the capital in the early 
                                1970s were still a stark reminder that there was much work left to be done. That they 
                                had narrowed so much was in no small part due to the relentless work of the Medical 
                                Officers of Health.
